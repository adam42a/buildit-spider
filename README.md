# buildit-spider

A web spider bot that crawls all pages belonging to a site linked to from the site's given landing page.

To see how it works, check out the unit test documentation in the unit test files.

Follow the code path to the App, Reader, Scanner and SiteNode classes for more Javadoc.

To run the unit tests, set it up with maven and use either your favourite IDE or run 'mvn test' on the command line.
