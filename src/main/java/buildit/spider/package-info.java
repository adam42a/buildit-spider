/**
 * 
 * <blockquote> Your task is to write a simple web crawler in a language of your
 * choice.
 * 
 * The crawler should be limited to one domain. Given a starting URL it should
 * visit all pages within the domain, but not follow the links to external sites
 * such as Google or Twitter.
 * 
 * The output should be a simple site map, showing links to other pages under
 * the same domain, links to static content such as images, and to external
 * URLs.
 * 
 * We would like to see what you can produce in a couple of hours – please don’t
 * spend much more than that. In addition, please
 * 
 * - ensure that what you do implement is production quality code
 * 
 * - briefly describe any tradeoffs you make through comments and / or in a
 * README file
 * 
 * - include the steps needed to build and run your solution
 * 
 * Once done, please make your solution available on Github and forward the
 * link. </blockquote>
